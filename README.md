Digital assets like computers, servers, and other electronic devices are seriously threatened by the growth or proliferation of malware. Malware has a significant negative impact on the IT infrastructure. Every person, business, organization, and major industry is vulnerable to various cyberattacks, including denial-of-service (DoS), distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), phishing, and more. Therefore, the need for data protection is more important. Cybercriminals may get into anyone's computer using malware to monitor online activity and take sensitive data like usernames and passwords. These assaults target financial and banking websites often in an effort to steal credit card details such the pin and CVV in order to make large sums of money. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to offer a reverse engineering tool-based method for identifying and analyzing malware. Malware study and Signature Generation, the suggested system, provides a summary of the study and goes on to produce malware signatures using the examined data. We generate malware signatures using Deep Belief Networks (DBN) model, TheZoo, Cuckoo Sandbox, Wireshark, and Ghidra, which are some of the most recent malware research tools. In identifying the malware infestation, this study would be extremely valuable to a wide range of individuals and significant businesses.
